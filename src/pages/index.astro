  {
    question: 'What is Cash Me Up and how does it work?',
    answer: 'Cash Me Up is a free platform that helps UK consumers access money they\'re owed through claims, grants, and cashback opportunities. We partner with regulated claims management companies and refer your details to them at no cost to you. We earn a referral commission from our partners — you never pay anything.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Cash Me Up really free? What\'s the catch?',
    answer: 'Yes, it\'s genuinely free to you — always. There is no catch. Our business model is based on referral commissions paid by our regulated partners, not by consumers. You will never be asked to pay anything to use our service, and if your claim is unsuccessful, you owe nothing to anyone.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a PCP claim?',
    answer: 'A PCP (Personal Contract Purchase) claim relates to the widespread mis-selling of car finance in the UK. If you had PCP or HP car finance between roughly 2007 and 2021, your lender may have secretly paid your car dealer a hidden commission that led you to pay more interest than you should have. The financial regulator found this practice to be widespread, and millions of consumers may be owed compensation — potentially £1,000s each.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know if I\'m eligible for a PCP claim?',
    answer: 'You may be eligible if you took out a PCP or HP (Hire Purchase) car finance agreement between 2007 and 2021 in the UK. The key question is whether your dealer received a discretionary commission from the lender — a practice that was banned by the regulator in January 2021. Most people who had car finance during this period could be eligible. You can check your eligibility on our <a href="/pcp-claims/eligibility/" class="text-[#2D6B2D] hover:underline">PCP Eligibility page</a>.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What else is coming to Cash Me Up beyond PCP claims?',
    answer: 'We\'re building a comprehensive platform for UK consumers. Coming soon: government grants and funding (energy efficiency, home improvement, business grants), cashback on everyday shopping, exclusive member discounts, and alerts when new compensation schemes go live. Join as a free member to be the first to know.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is my personal data protected?',
    answer: 'We take data protection seriously. We are fully compliant with UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. Your information is stored securely and is only shared with our regulated claims management partners for the purpose of processing your claim or enquiry. We never sell your data to third parties. See our <a href="/privacy-policy/" class="text-[#2D6B2D] hover:underline">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does a PCP claim take?',
    answer: 'PCP claims are currently taking longer than usual due to the regulator\'s industry-wide review, which paused the standard 8-week complaint response window. The regulator is expected to provide final guidance in 2025, after which claims should progress more quickly. Our partners will keep you updated throughout the process.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need any documents or paperwork to start a PCP claim?',
    answer: 'No. You don\'t need to dig out old paperwork to begin. Simply fill in our quick form with your basic details and our partners can begin tracing your finance agreements. They have the tools and expertise to locate your agreements even if you don\'t have the original documents.',

            Between 2007 and 2021, millions of UK consumers took out PCP (Personal Contract Purchase) or HP car finance.
