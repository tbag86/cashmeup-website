  {
    question: 'Do I need to have the original finance agreement?',
    answer: 'No. You don\'t need to find old paperwork. Our regulated partners have the tools and legal authority to trace your finance agreements using your personal details. Even if you\'ve moved house, changed your name, or have no records whatsoever, they can usually locate your historic agreements.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I still claim if the car was on a joint agreement?',
    answer: 'Yes. Joint finance agreements are equally eligible. Each person named on the agreement could potentially make a claim. It\'s worth both parties submitting their details, as claims can sometimes be made individually even on joint agreements, depending on the circumstances.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I voluntarily terminated my PCP agreement?',
    answer: 'You can still make a claim. Voluntary termination (VT) is your legal right under the Consumer Credit Act, and it doesn\'t affect your eligibility to claim for the mis-selling of the original commission arrangement. The claim relates to what happened at the point of sale, not what happened at the end of the agreement.',
  },
  {
    question: 'I had a business car on PCP — can I still claim?',
    answer: 'Business-use vehicles are more complex. PCP claims primarily relate to consumer credit regulated agreements, which typically apply to personal vehicles. However, if the car was also used for personal purposes and the agreement was a regulated credit agreement, you may still be eligible. It\'s worth checking with our regulated partners.',
  },
  {
    question: 'I\'m not sure if my finance was PCP or HP — does it matter?',
    answer: 'Not significantly for eligibility purposes. Both PCP (Personal Contract Purchase) and HP (Hire Purchase) agreements arranged through dealerships during the qualifying period may be covered. The key factor is whether a discretionary commission arrangement was in place — and most dealership-arranged finance during that period was affected.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my lender has gone out of business?',
    answer: 'If your lender has ceased trading, your claim may still be possible through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) in some circumstances. Our regulated partners can advise on whether this route is available for your specific situation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I claim if I was in arrears or had a poor credit history at the time?',
    answer: 'Yes. The PCP mis-selling claim is about what happened at the point of sale — specifically, whether a hidden commission was paid that wasn\'t disclosed to you. Your credit history or whether you kept up with repayments doesn\'t affect your eligibility to claim for the undisclosed commission.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I already made a PCP complaint directly to my lender and they rejected it?',
    answer: 'Even if your lender rejected a previous complaint, it may be worth re-submitting or escalating to the Financial Ombudsman Service given the new Court of Appeal rulings and the regulator\'s ongoing review. The legal landscape has changed significantly since most initial complaints were rejected. A regulated claims partner can advise you on this.',
