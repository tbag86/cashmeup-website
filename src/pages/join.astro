    question: 'What does Cash Me Up membership include?',
    answer: 'Membership is free and gives you: early access to new money-saving opportunities when they launch; personalised alerts when claims, grants, or cashback schemes match your profile; exclusive member-only deals and discounts; priority access to the Cash Me Up platform as it grows. There\'s no subscription, no payment, and no obligation to use any service we notify you about.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is membership really free forever?',
    answer: 'Yes. Cash Me Up membership is and will always be free for consumers. Our business model is based on referral commissions from regulated partners — you are never charged for membership or for using any of our services.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What will you do with my email address?',
    answer: 'We will use your email address to send you notifications about new opportunities that match your profile — new claims schemes, grants, cashback offers, and member deals. We will only send marketing emails if you give us permission. You can unsubscribe at any time via the link in any email. We will never sell your email address to third parties.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is this different from just submitting a PCP claim?',
    answer: 'Submitting a PCP claim connects you with a regulated partner for that specific claim. Membership is broader — it means you\'ll be first to know when any new opportunity goes live, whether that\'s a new type of claim, a government grant scheme, a cashback offer, or an exclusive deal. Members also get priority access to new features and services.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I unsubscribe from emails if I change my mind?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Every email we send includes an unsubscribe link. You can also contact us directly at any time to request removal from our list or deletion of your data. Under UK GDPR, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time.',
  },
