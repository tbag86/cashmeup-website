Today, we're launching Cash Me Up — and we think it's something genuinely different.

The UK is full of money that's sitting in the wrong pockets. Billions of pounds in compensation owed to car finance customers. Millions of pounds in government grants that go unclaimed every year. Cashback and savings that most people never access because nobody told them how.

We're here to change that. Cash Me Up is a platform that helps ordinary UK consumers find and access all of this — for free, forever.

## Why We Built This

Here's the honest truth: the financial services industry has consistently failed ordinary consumers. PCP mis-selling is just the latest chapter in a long history of banks, lenders, and financial institutions prioritising their own profits over customers' interests.

The PPI scandal. Packaged bank account mis-selling. Interest rate swap mis-selling. Hidden card payment fees. And now PCP car finance.

Every single time, the pattern is the same. Financial companies exploit complexity and information asymmetry — the fact that most people don't have time to read every clause of every financial product they use. And when the regulator eventually catches up, the compensation process is complicated, slow, and designed in ways that many consumers find confusing.

Cash Me Up exists to be the bridge. We do the work of understanding the rules, identifying the opportunities, and connecting consumers with the right regulated partners — so you can claim what you're owed without becoming a financial expert yourself.

## Starting With PCP Claims

We're launching with a focus on PCP car finance claims because the opportunity is enormous and the window is now.

If you had PCP or HP car finance between 2007 and 2021, you were likely affected by discretionary commission arrangements — a practice the regulator found to be widespread and potentially unlawful. The Court of Appeal ruled in October 2024 that undisclosed dealer commissions were unlawful, and most legal observers expect the Supreme Court to uphold this finding in 2025.

The result could be billions of pounds returned to UK consumers — one of the largest consumer compensation events in UK history.

We're proud to be helping consumers navigate this. Our process is simple:

1. Fill in our 2-minute form with your basic details
2. Our regulated claims management partners assess your case for free
3. If you have a claim, they handle everything on your behalf
4. You get paid — we never take anything from your compensation

That's it. No hidden fees. No complex paperwork. No endless phone calls. Just a simple, free service that puts your money back where it belongs.

## What's Coming Next

PCP claims are just the beginning. Over the coming months and years, we're building a comprehensive platform for UK consumers to access every legitimate money opportunity available to them.

**Government Grants (Q2 2025)**

The UK government runs dozens of grant schemes for homeowners and businesses. Energy efficiency grants. Home improvement funding. Business start-up support. The problem is that most people have no idea these schemes exist, and the application processes are often complex.

We're building a grants matching service that uses your profile to identify every grant you're eligible for and guides you through the application. Completely free.

**Cashback & Discounts (Q3 2025)**

Every time you shop online, there's a good chance you could be earning cashback. Most people aren't. We're building a cashback platform that works with hundreds of UK retailers to make sure our members never miss a penny.

Combined with exclusive member discounts negotiated with top UK brands, this could save our members significant money on their everyday spending.

**Claims Alerts (Q4 2025)**

New compensation schemes and claim opportunities emerge regularly. Energy mis-selling. Overcharged bank fees. Holiday claim windows. Most people find out about these opportunities too late — after the window has closed.

Cash Me Up members will receive instant alerts when new opportunities launch, with personalised matching based on their profile. Be first in line, every time.

## Our Promise to You

Before we close, we want to be absolutely clear about what we stand for.

**We are free.** Our service to consumers is and will always be free. We earn referral commissions from our regulated partners — you never pay anything.

**We are transparent.** We tell you exactly how we make money, who our partners are, and what happens to your data. No small print designed to confuse.

**We are on your side.** We only recommend opportunities we genuinely believe are legitimate and valuable. We never push you towards anything that's not in your interest.

**We are consumer-first.** Every decision we make starts with one question: is this good for the consumer?

We're genuinely excited about what we're building. And we think you will be too.
